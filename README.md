üöÄ Setup and Installation
To get this project running locally, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/varshith-dev/quickbytes/
cd quickbytes

Set up Firebase:

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

In your project, go to Build > Firestore Database and create a new database. Start in test mode for easy setup (you can configure security rules later).

Go to your Project Settings (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon) and scroll down to the "Your apps" section.

Click on the Web icon (</>) to create a new web app.

After registering the app, Firebase will provide you with a firebaseConfig object. Copy this object.

Configure the Project:

Open the index.html file.

Find the firebaseConfig object within the <script type="module"> tag (around line 300).

Replace the placeholder keys with the actual keys you copied from your Firebase project.



Create Firestore Collections:
For the app to work, you need to manually create the following collections in your Firestore Database:

categories: Stores the menu categories. Each document should have a name field (e.g., { name: "Beverages" }).

menu: Stores the menu items.

orders: Stores completed orders.

Run the Application:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can use a live server extension in your code editor for the best experience.
